## ISS Tracker

This project aims to create a website which tracks the live position of the Internation Space Station using [this](https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer) API.

Things to add:
- Call the api to get data and print it in console.
- Add a map interface in a box, use leaflet.js or mapbox.
- Add styling and css to the page to make it look better.
- Add a pointer to the map based on a location.
- Call the API every 3 seconds and update the pointer position to make the space station look like its moving.
- Change the default pointer icon to ISS png image (any image will work 15*15 px).

Feel free to raise any more issues or add more features to the project.
You can even update this readme file and make it look better.
